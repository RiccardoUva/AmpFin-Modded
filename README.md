# AmpFin Fork

**Note: This is a fork!**

An older version of AmpFin because the newest release is laggy as heck...

This version includes the following changes:
- Playlists now display the playlist image set in Jellyfin instead of animated colors.
- Changed accent color.
- Updated the icon to better fit iOS 18 dark style.
- Lyrics are anticipated 800ms so that they appear earlier so that you have time to read them before the artist sings them

More updates and changes are planned, but due to time constraints, I'm uncertain when they'll be released. However, I intend to make pull requests on the original repository of the developer to incorporate these changes. I just need to find time to do so. For now, there's this version that I created a couple of weeks ago.
