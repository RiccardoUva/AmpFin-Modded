THIS IS A FORK!
An old version of AmpFin cuz the newest release it's laggy af...

this version has the following changes:
- Playlists display the playlist image that you can set in jellyfin instead of the animated colors...
- Changed accent color
- Changed the icon to fit better Ios 18 dark style

  other stuff coming soon, i don't have much time so i don't know when i'll release updates, by the way i'm gonna make pull requests on the original repo of the dev and ask for these changes... i just have to find time to do that, for now there's this version that i made a couple of weeks ago

original repo: https://github.com/rasmuslos/AmpFin
